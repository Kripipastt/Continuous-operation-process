Nature is all around us. We see it every day. It’s the sunset, the sunrise, the song of birds, the blooming оf flowers, the wind that blows, etc. These signs are an integral part of our lives. On the one hand we cherish these natural blessings, on the other hand – we don’t appreciate fully their importance.
